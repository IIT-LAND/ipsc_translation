# Enrichment analysis

Reproducible analysis to run enrichment test between M10-NPC module from Griesi-Oliveira et al., (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-0669-9) and M25 from Lombardo et al., 2017 (https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-017-0147-7) and geneM15 co-expression module from Gandal et al., 2018 (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6420/eaat8127)

```enrichmentAnalysis.Rmd``` or ```enrichmentAnalysis.html``` has all steps of the analysis and can be found in the code directory.

Gene lists for the analysis can be found in the ```data``` directory.

Overlap between M10-NPC and M25 or geneM15 can be found in the ```results``` directory.

Figures used in the html analysis report are found within the ```figures``` directory.
